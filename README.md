Added a simplistic Pong game, added a more complex PongV2 game, added a simple password generator, a more complex password generator and a decryption mechanism. I have also added a Windows 11 upgrade checker. On the decrypter, I am getting around to removing the password function, though it might just stay for aesthetic purpose. The Windows 11 Upgrade Checker will be relatively simple for the time being, I am going to likely upgrade it soon, with a V2.
